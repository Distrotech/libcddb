It\r\ntries to be as cross-platform as possible.  The initial libary will\r\nhave a C API.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nThe API documentation can be consulted on the project homepage:\r\n    http://libcddb.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create your own copy of this documentation in both\r\nHTML and LaTeX format using the doxygen program (http://doxygen.org).\r\nIf you have doxygen installed, execute the following command in the\r\ndoc/ directory:\r\n    doxygen doxygen.conf\r\n\r\nThis will create two subdirectories html/ and latex/ in which you will\r\nfind the documentation in the respective formats.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILING\r\n\r\nSee INSTALL for instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING\r\n\r\nThe regression tests also test the networking code.  For all these\r\ntests to complete successfully, you will need an Internet connection.\r\nThe FreeDB server at www.freedb.org needs to be accessible on both\r\nports 888 (CDDBP protocol) and 80 (HTTP protocol).  The test also\r\nincludes code to verify the proxy functionality.  These tests can only\r\nsucceed when the 'http_proxy' enviroment variable is defined.  Set\r\nthis variable with a statement similar as the one below:\r\n\r\n    export http_proxy='http://proxy:80'\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe primary source of information for this project is:\r\n    http://libcddb.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nBugs, patches, feature request can be submitted on the project\r\nhomepage:\r\n    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcddb/\r\n\r\nOr they can be send directly to me:\r\n    Kris Verbeeck <airborne@advalvas.be>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
